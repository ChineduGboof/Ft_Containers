Let's consider a diagram of a binary search tree and assign some random values:

```
         6
       /   \
      3     9
     / \   / \
    1   5 7   12
```

Now, let's step through the construction of the iterator using the given `begin()` function:

1. Check if the root of the tree is null (empty tree case):
   - In this example, the root is not null, so we proceed to the else block.

2. Construct the iterator with the minimum node as the starting point:
   - The `_tree.getMinimum(_tree.getRoot())` function finds the minimum node in the tree, which is the leftmost node.
   - In our example, the minimum node is 1.
   - The `_tree.getRoot()` returns a pointer to the root node, which is 6.
   - The `_tree.getEndNode()` returns a special end node used to represent the end of the tree.
   - So, the iterator is constructed as `iterator(1, 6, end_node)`.

3. Return the constructed iterator:
   - The constructed iterator is returned by the `begin()` function and can be used to iterate over the map starting from the smallest key.

The iterator constructed using the above process will point to the smallest key in the map, which is 1 in our example. It allows you to traverse the map in ascending order based on the key values.

## Code

    iterator begin() {
        if (!_tree.getRoot()) {
            return iterator(_tree.getEndNode(), _tree.getRoot(), _tree.getEndNode());
        } else {
            return iterator(_tree.getMinimum(_tree.getRoot()), _tree.getRoot(), _tree.getEndNode());
        }
    }
