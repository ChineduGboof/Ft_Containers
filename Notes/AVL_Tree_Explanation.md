# AVL Tree

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most one. This balance is achieved through automatic rotations during node insertion and deletion. AVL trees are particularly useful in implementing maps or dictionaries in C++ due to their efficient searching and balanced structure.

## Why AVL Trees are Useful for Implementing Maps in C++

### 1. Balanced Structure
An AVL tree ensures that the heights of its left and right subtrees are balanced, maintaining a maximum height difference of one. This balance prevents the tree from becoming skewed and guarantees efficient search operations. 

### Balanced AVL Tree
```
      20
     /  \
   10    30
  /  \     \
 5   15    35
```

### 2. Faster Searching
Due to their balanced structure, AVL trees provide faster searching compared to unbalanced binary search trees. The height of an AVL tree is logarithmic, resulting in faster lookup times when storing and retrieving key-value pairs.

### 3. Automatic Balancing
When a new key-value pair is inserted into an AVL tree, the tree automatically rebalances itself through rotations. Rotations adjust the tree's structure to maintain balance, ensuring that operations remain efficient even after insertions or deletions.

### Automatic Balancing
Inserting a node with key 25:
```
Before Insertion          After Insertion
      20                         20
     /  \                       /  \
   10    30                   10    30
  /  \     \                 /  \     \
 5   15    35               5   15    35
         /                        \
        25                        25
```

### 4. Efficient Memory Usage
The balanced nature of AVL trees guarantees that the height of the tree is logarithmic, resulting in efficient memory utilization. This is especially important when implementing maps or dictionaries where memory efficiency is a key consideration.

### 5. Standard Template Library (STL) Support
The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides an implementation of the `std::map` and `std::multimap` containers, which internally use red-black trees (a variant of AVL trees) for efficient key-value storage. This demonstrates the practical usage and reliability of AVL trees in real-world applications.

AVL trees provide a balance between efficient searching, automatic balancing, and memory utilization, making them an excellent choice for implementing maps or dictionaries in C++. Their self-balancing property ensures that operations remain fast, even with frequent insertions or deletions.
## Disadvantages of AVL Tree

- Implementing AVL trees can be more complex compared to simpler tree structures.
- Certain operations in AVL trees may have higher constant factors, impacting performance in some cases.

## Maximum & Minimum Number of Nodes

- The maximum number of nodes in an AVL tree is given by the formula 2^H+1 - 1, where H is the height of the tree.
- The minimum number of nodes of height H is determined by the minimum number of nodes of height H-1 plus the minimum number of nodes of height H-2, plus one. The base cases are H(0) = 1 and H(1) = 2.

AVL trees are efficient and balanced data structures that excel in scenarios requiring fast searching and automatic balancing. They are commonly used in various applications, including databases, dictionaries, and ordered sets. By maintaining balance, AVL trees ensure optimal performance and effective memory usage.
