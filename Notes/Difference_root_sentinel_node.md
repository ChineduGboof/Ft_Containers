Certainly! Let's consider a diagram of an AVL tree:

```
             8
           /   \
          5     10
         / \      \
        3   6      15
```

In this diagram, the number 8 represents the root node of the AVL tree.

Now, let's introduce the concept of a sentinel node. The sentinel node is an additional node that is used to simplify certain operations and avoid handling special cases. It acts as a boundary node and is typically represented as a special node with specific properties, often having null or dummy values for its key and value.

Let's add a sentinel node to the AVL tree diagram:

```
             8
           /   \
          5     10
         / \      \
        3   6      15
                    \
                     S
```

In this diagram, the letter S represents the sentinel node. It is shown as a leaf node attached to the right side of the node with the key 15.

Now, let's discuss the difference between the sentinel node and the root node:

1. Root Node: The root node is the topmost node in the tree. In our diagram, the number 8 represents the root node. The root node holds a valid key-value pair and serves as the starting point for traversing the tree.

2. Sentinel Node: The sentinel node is an additional node that acts as a boundary or sentinel value. It does not hold a valid key-value pair and is used to simplify certain operations. In our diagram, the letter S represents the sentinel node. It is typically placed as a leaf node on the side where the tree does not have any elements. The sentinel node helps in avoiding special cases during tree traversal or other operations.

In summary, the root node is the topmost node of the tree, holding a valid key-value pair, while the sentinel node is an additional node that acts as a boundary or sentinel value, simplifying certain operations. The sentinel node does not hold a valid key-value pair and helps in avoiding special cases.
