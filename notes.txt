Tests:


Check the following Functions

end()
rbegin()
rend()
reserve()
resize()

test the  vec.insert(vec.end(), 6);
does it insert this 6 to the end of the vector or does it insert the previous value in the vector


test the fill insert function cos i changed its implementation


check max_size (will fail on char)

test the operator-- for reverse-iterator
testers:
terminator


changes:
reverse_iterator operator--(int)


AVL Tree

-1 => greater on the right side
1 => greater on the left side
0 => equal on both sides

left side - right side

Construct AVL tree by inserting the following data:

14, 17, 11, 7, 53, 4, 13, 12, 8, 60, 19, 16, 20

Solution: Arrange them starting from top to bottom, taking note of their height
-> Height of a node with no connecting nodes(branch) under it is 0
-> Add the heights of the sub branches and add 1 to get the height of the main branch
-> subtract the heights to get the balance factor (subtract from left to right)
-> Balance factor cannot be greater than 1 or less than -1
-> When you the do a rotation, the median element will be the root

                less then <---- ----> Greater than
                             [14]

                    [11]              [17]

            [7]                                 [53]
